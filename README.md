## 🚧 Challenges Faced & Technical Solutions

Developing a platform of this scale presented several unique challenges. Here is how they were solved:

### 1. **Authentication State & Middleware Conflicts**

- **Problem**: Admin users were frequently redirected incorrectly when accessing protected specific paths like `/dashboard/settings` due to race conditions between client-side session hooks and middleware.
- **Solution**: Refactored the dashboard layout to use a custom `getCurrentUser()` server action. that reads the session directly from the secure HTTP-only cookie on the server. This ensures the role check happens reliably before rendering any UI, eliminating flash-of-unauthorized-content.

### 2. **Session Data Persistence**

- **Problem**: Default NextAuth sessions only return basic info (name, email), but the app required specialized data like `NID` and `Role` to be available globally without database queries on every page.
- **Solution**: Customized the JWT callback in `auth.config.ts` to persist `role`, `nid`, and `contact` into the token payload, and typed the `Session` interface to expose these fields throughout the client application.

### 3. **Type-Safe Complex Forms**

- **Problem**: Managing state for a multi-step booking wizard with dependent fields (e.g., Duration affecting Cost) while ensuring the data structure matches the backend Expectation.
- **Solution**: Utilized `react-hook-form` with a comprehensive Zod schema. We separated the schema into a shared validation library (`src/lib/validations/booking.ts`) to ensure the server validated exactly what the client submitted, reusing the same logic.

### 4. **Strict Localized Validation**

- **Problem**: Default string validators were insufficient for Bangladesh specific data. Users could enter invalid NIDs or phone numbers.
- **Solution**: Implemented custom Zod regex refinements (`/^\d{13}$/` for NID) to enforce strict 13-digit inputs at both the form level and database insertion layer. This prevents "bad data" from ever reaching the core logic.

### 5. **Stripe Webhook Security**

- **Problem**: Ensuring that payment confirmations were legitimate and not spoofed, and handling the asynchronous nature of webhooks (e.g., payment succeeds but user closes browser).
- **Solution**: Implemented a robust webhook endpoint that validates the raw request body against the Stripe signature. Used idempotent updates (updating status from `PENDING` to `CONFIRMED`) to strictly handle duplicate events safely.

### 6. **SEO & Social Previews**

- **Problem**: Next.js 13+ metadata system requires careful handling of absolute URLs for OpenGraph images, which often breaks across different environments (local vs production).
- **Solution**: Implemented a global `metadataBase` configuration in `layout.tsx` using environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`), allowing all child pages to use relative paths for images and canonicals cleanly.

## 🛡️ Admin Access

To access the admin dashboard, you can use the seed script to create a default admin or register a new user and manually update their role in the database.

**Default Admin Credentials** (if seeded):

- **Email**: `admin@care.xyz`
- **Password**: `Admin@123456`

---

## 🎯 Project Architecture

### Database Schema Structure

- **User**: Handles authentication & profile data (Role, NID, Contact).
- **Service**: Defines available care options (Category, Rate, Active Status).
- **Booking**: The core entity linking Users to Services (Duration, Location, Cost, Status).
- **Payment**: Records financial transactions, strictly linked to Bookings via Stripe Intent IDs.

### Folder Structure

Code is organized by **Feature** within the App Router:

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── (marketing)/     # Public Landing & Info Pages
│   ├── (protected)/     # Authenticated User Flows (Dashboard)
│   ├── admin/           # Secured Admin Panel
│   ├── api/             # Webhooks & Auth Endpoints
├── components/
│   ├── ui/              # Reusable Shadcn Primitives
│   ├── auth/            # Login/Register Forms
│   ├── bookings/        # Booking Logic & UI
└── lib/                 # Shared Utilities (Validation, Prisma, Utils)
```

_**Note**: This project follows strict industry standard coding practices, employing a "Feature-First" architecture, separating Server Actions, Components, and Utilities for maximum maintainability._
